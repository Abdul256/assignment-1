## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")      # data manipulation and visualization
library(lubridate)      # easily work with dates and times
install.packages("fpp2")           # working with time series data
library(zoo)            # working with time series data)




#calculate 12-month rolling average 

```

```{r}
 df1 %>%
  mutate_at(vars(V3, V4, V5), ~as.numeric(.))
 str(df1)
 
```

output is displayed).
